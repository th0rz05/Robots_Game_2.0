The player is placed in a maze made up of high-voltage fences and posts.
There are also some interceptor robots that will try to destroy the player.
If the player touches the maze or any of these robots, that is the end of the game.
The robots are also destroyed when they touch the fences/posts or when they collide with each other.
Every time the player moves , each robot moves one cell closer!
There are two options: exit the maze or kill all robots.

In the draw of the maze:
* = electrical fence or post; + = non-electrical post
H = player (alive); h = player (dead);
R = robot (alive); r = robot (destroyed=dead/stuck);
O = exit;

The movement is indicated by typing one of the letters indicated below:

                    Q               W               E

# Robots_Game_2.0

Welcome to Robots_Game_2.0, a game developed for the [Programming Curricular Unit](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/UCURR_GERAL.FICHA_UC_VIEW?pv_ocorrencia_id=501671)
at FEUP. In this game, you will play as a player trapped in a maze with electrical fences and killer robots. Your goal is to escape or kill all the robots by making them go into the electrical fences. 

You can do this because the robots will follow you, so you can lead them to hit the walls and die. As you play, the scoreboard will be updated with your time.
